				<p>After carrying out the mise en place that was discussed in the Preparation page, you should have all the equipment and prepared ingredients ready in separate containers. Remember that the Kahlua-espresso mixture should be either cold or at room temperature. If you didn't follow the mise en place steps, then I strongly recommend that you go back and do so, because the recipe was written on the basis of proper preparation.</p>
				<p class="before-list">Proceed to this recipe once you're ready:</p>
				<ol class="page-ols">
					<li>Separate the eggs from the whites and yolks, then place them into 2 separate medium-sized mixing bowls. Add 1 tablespoon of white sugar into each bowl. (Place the egg whites in the mixer's bowl if you're using a stand mixer.)</li>
					<li>Whisk the sugared egg yolks. The mixture of egg yolks should have a thick, "ribbon" texture. </li>
					<li>Whisk the sugared egg whites. The mixture of egg whites should be foamy or have "peaks". Do not over-whisk the egg whites.</li>
					<li>Divide the mascarpone cheese into two equal portions, adding half to the egg white bowl and the other half to the egg yolk bowl. Gently fold the mascarpone with each egg mixture with a spatula, starting with the egg white mixture. Both of the mixtures should have an even and uniform consistency/texture.</li>
					<li>Dip the biscuits in the espresso-Kahlua bowl (both sides) very quickly (one second on each side). (If the biscuits are soaked, they will become too soggy and not have a fluffy cake texture.) Place the dipped biscuits, sugar side facing down, in the container. </li>
					<li>Arrange the dipped biscuits and fill the container to create the first layer of cake. Do not leave any gaps between them. If needed, break the biscuits to make them fit in your container.</li>
					<li>Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture over the 1st layer of biscuits. Use a spatula to evenly spread it over any gaps.</li>
					<li>Dust cocoa powder over the layer of the egg yolk mixture using a sifter. Sprinkle the dark chocolate shavings on top of the cocoa powder. (This can be done in any order)</li>
					<li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 with another layer of biscuits. Pour on the egg white mixture. Dust cocoa powder over the top and add grated chocolate.</li>
					<li>Store the assembled tiramisu in the fridge for at least 6-8 hours (it's best chilled overnight). Fridge it for up to 24 hours.</li>
