<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Welcome to Tiramisu 101! If you are a fan of authentic tiramisu and want to learn how to make it at home, you have come to the right place. The recipe took me about a year to refine and it has always been a crowd-pleaser. To start with some background information, tiramisu is a type of cake that originated in Italy. Broken down, tira mi s√π is a phrase that means "pick me up", which makes it a fitting name for this dessert because it typically has rich ingredients such as espresso and liqueur. </p>

<p>Along with the recipe, this site will also provide noteworthy information on related topics that set you up for success. This dessert is not exactly hard to make, but it can be easy to make mistakes during the process if you are not careful. Therefore, I recommend reading all the pages in the arranged sequence before jumping straight into the recipe, especially if you are new to making tiramisu and/or dessert. (For example, continue to "Ingredients" and then work your way down.)</p>
